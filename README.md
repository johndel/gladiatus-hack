# Gladiatus Hack Script

This script will play automatically your gladiator. I reach him level 100 without playing very much! I created it with selenium (I really love it) and ruby. The game sucks, you can make automate scripts that plays by their own. Fail! One day I'll make a better text-based rpg that you will have to think a bit. In the meantime, hack it as there is no tomorrow.  

### Usage
In the **glad-methods.rb file** you will find the methods that plays your character. Just change the login and password. If you are from another country, change the necessary files to represent your language.

In the **attack.rb** you will find a simple workflow I chose to play automatically. Just run `ruby attack.rb` and it will open your browser and make everything by it's own. It can't be detected because it is like you are sitting in front of your pc and play.

### Future
I may create a script that make the character to eat automatically, but I don't like the game and I create the above just because I wanted to test how much it sucks. Now I know I can abuse it so much, I won't do anything else.
